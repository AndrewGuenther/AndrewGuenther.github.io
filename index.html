    I'm a software engineer with over ten years of experience designing, building, and monitoring applications at scale, especially in AWS.

<p>
    I'm currently building the future of hyperspectral intelligence at <a href="https://orbitalsidekick.com/">Orbital Sidekick</a>. Previously, I spent seven years at AWS building a variety of external and internal products serving millions of customers. And before that, I got a Master's degree in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.calpoly.edu">Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo</a>.

    I <a href="http://www.twitter.com/codebrewed">tweet</a> about cloud stuff, brew my own <a href="https://untappd.com/DrawbridgeBrewing">beer</a>, and sometimes write <a href="http://www.github.com/AndrewGuenther">code</a> for fun.
